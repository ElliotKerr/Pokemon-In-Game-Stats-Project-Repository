# Pokemon In Game Stats Project Repository
 Analysing the In Game Stats of Pokemon 
The Datasets that I used are the 10 csv files in the folder. The 9 that are labeled pokemon_data_gen#.csv are the files that contain the Pokemon's names, heights, weights, etc but more importantly the Pokedex number of each Pokemon.
The last file is pokemon-stats.csv. I found this file with some mistakes in it, so I corrected them and also added the types of all Pokemon and the missing data for the new Pokemon released in the Generation 9 DLC.
